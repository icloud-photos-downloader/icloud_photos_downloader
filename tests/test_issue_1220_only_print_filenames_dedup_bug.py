"""Test for issue #1220: --only-print-filenames downloads live photo video files during deduplication

https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader/issues/1220

Bug Description:
- When using --only-print-filenames, no files should be downloaded
- However, during live photo deduplication, the MOV file gets downloaded
- This happens because the deduplication logic changes the filename and resets file_exists to False
- The download then proceeds despite only_print_filenames being True
